This document is P8105 Homework 2.

I loaded necessary packages (e.g. `tidyverse` and `dplyr`).

## Problem 1

``` r
subway_df = read_csv(
  file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
  na = c(".", "NA", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) |> 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The data has 1,868 observations and 19 variables. The variables include
line, station name, station longitude/latitude, routes 1-11, entry and
entrance type, vending, and ADA compliance.

To clean the data, the CSV data file was imported, missing values were
excluded, and the variable names were cleaned such that they were all
lowercase. I selected only the variables listed above and changed the
“entry” column so that YES/NO character values were converted to
TRUE/FALSE logistic values.
